Install Java, Simple Build Tool, and Git

Clone this repository with:

git clone git://github.com/zcox/lift-multi-comet.git

Then cd into lift-multi-comet and type:
sbt

At the sbt prompt, type:
update

Then:
jetty-run

Point your browser to:
http://localhost:8080/

To demonstrate the browser refresh problem, at the sbt prompt type:
jetty-restart

Wait a few seconds and you should start seeing a lot of requests like this:

And then the "Vote" links will be broken.  And jetty-stop will not properly shut down Jetty.  You'll probably have to Ctrl+C to to kill Jetty and sbt.

You can also test this out on Tomcat+MySQL.  Just set up a JNDI connection named "lift" in Tomcat that points to MySQL and drop the .war into Tomcat's webapps dir. Run the app and ensure it works. Then restart Tomcat and observe the infinite requests.
